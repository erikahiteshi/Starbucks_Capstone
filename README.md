# Starbucks Capstone Project
In this project, I'll apply data engineering and a Machine Learning Model to analyze data provided by Starbucks on their interaction with offers.

This directory contains three data sets:
1. Portfolio.json : a file which details the offers sent by Starbucks
2. Profile.json : a file which gives us details on the starbucks members
3. transcript: a file which details the transactions & offers sent out

# Models
We have used a variety of models;
1. Taking the naive assumption as a baseline
2. Logistic Regression
3. K Nearest Neighbours
4. Random Forest
