    "# Starbucks Capstone Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type. This data set is a simplified version of the real Starbucks app because the underlying simulator only has one product whereas Starbucks actually sells dozens of products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every offer has a validity period before the offer expires. As an example, a BOGO offer might be valid for only 5 days. You'll see in the data set that informational offers have a validity period even though these ads are merely providing information about a product; for example, if an informational offer has 7 days of validity, you can assume the customer is feeling the influence of the offer for 7 days after receiving the advertisement.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be given transactional data showing user purchases made on the app including the timestamp of purchase and the amount of money spent on a purchase. This transactional data also has a record for each offer that a user receives as well as a record for when a user actually views the offer. There are also records for when a user completes an offer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind as well that someone using the app might make a purchase through the app without having received an offer or seen an offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "To give an example, a user could receive a discount offer buy 10 dollars get 2 off on Monday. The offer is valid for 10 days from receipt. If the customer accumulates at least 10 dollars in purchases during the validity period, the customer completes the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are a few things to watch out for in this data set. Customers do not opt into the offers that they receive; in other words, a user can receive an offer, never actually view the offer, and still complete the offer. For example, a user might receive the \"buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer\", but the user never opens the offer during the 10 day validity period. The customer spends 15 dollars during those ten days. There will be an offer completion record in the data set; however, the customer was not influenced by the offer because the customer never viewed the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes data cleaning especially important and tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also want to take into account that some demographic groups will make purchases even if they don't receive an offer. From a business perspective, if a customer is going to make a 10 dollar purchase without an offer anyway, you wouldn't want to send a buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer. You'll want to try to assess what a certain demographic group will buy when not receiving any offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Advice\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is a capstone project, you are free to analyze the data any way you see fit. For example, you could build a machine learning model that predicts how much someone will spend based on demographics and offer type. Or you could build a model that predicts whether or not someone will respond to an offer. Or, you don't need to build a machine learning model at all. You could develop a set of heuristics that determine what offer you should send to each customer (i.e., 75 percent of women customers who were 35 years old responded to offer A vs 40 percent from the same demographic to offer B, so send offer A)."

    "# Data Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is contained in three files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)\n",
    "* profile.json - demographic data for each customer\n",
    "* transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the schema and explanation of each variable in the files:\n",
    "\n",
    "**portfolio.json**\n",
    "* id (string) - offer id\n",
    "* offer_type (string) - type of offer ie BOGO, discount, informational\n",
    "* difficulty (int) - minimum required spend to complete an offer\n",
    "* reward (int) - reward given for completing an offer\n",
    "* duration (int) - time for offer to be open, in days\n",
    "* channels (list of strings)\n",
    "\n",
    "**profile.json**\n",
    "* age (int) - age of the customer \n",
    "* became_member_on (int) - date when customer created an app account\n",
    "* gender (str) - gender of the customer (note some entries contain 'O' for other rather than M or F)\n",
    "* id (str) - customer id\n",
    "* income (float) - customer's income\n",
    "\n",
    "**transcript.json**\n",
    "* event (str) - record description (ie transaction, offer received, offer viewed, etc.)\n",
    "* person (str) - customer id\n",
    "* time (int) - time in hours since start of test. The data begins at time t=0\n",
    "* value - (dict of strings) - either an offer id or transaction amount depending on the record\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you are using the workspace, you will need to go to the terminal and run the command `conda update pandas` before reading in the files. This is because the version of pandas in the workspace cannot read in the transcript.json file correctly, but the newest version of pandas can. You can access the termnal from the orange icon in the top left of this notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can see how to access the terminal and how the install works using the two images below.  First you need to access the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pic1.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you will want to run the above command:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pic2.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",

    "### Problem Statement & Metrics\n",
    "Using the three datasets, I am going to build a model that predicts whether an offer will be successful or not. First I will cleanse the datasets and then combine them together. I will make a new column of whether the offer went through (was successful).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to assess, i will be looking at the naive model which assumes that all offers are successful. This will be the base. We can then evaluate other models and check their accuracy and F1-score. as the F1-score is the combination of precision and recall, this makes a better metric to check performance. \n"

    "2. Logistic Regression: This model is extremely useful for classification as it is useful for understanding the influence of several independednt variables on a single outcome variable. There are however some disadvantages to this model such as assming predictors are independent of each other.\n",
    "3. Random Forest: This method fits a number of decision trees on various sub-samples or datasets and uses average to improve the predictive accuracy on the model. This is useful for our example as it can reduce overfitting which we see often in Decision Tree Classifiers. The downside to this however is that it can be a lengthy model to run. (which we do see in our case).\n",
    "4. K-Nearest Neighbours: This is extremely to implement. This method calculates the distances of a new data point to all of the training data points. We will be using Euclidean distance as Manhatten is not appropriate here. I will use a range of K (for k nearest points). One of the negatives of KNN is that is does not work well with high dimension data. As our data has < 15 columns it seems ok to use in this instance. As we have used one hot encoding this should reduce any issues with categorical data."

    "The aim of this project was to have some insight into the Starbucks dataset and look at general information from it. This involved working on lots of data cleansing as there were quite a few issues with the data such as duplicates and missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "I combined the three datasets and made a new column which indicated if the offer had been successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then used accuracy and F1-score to measure my models. I started by taking the naive bayes model which assumes all offers were successful. This gave an accuracy score of around 48%. I then used logistic regression & random forest models & KNN to predict. All of these models had similar accuracy & F1 scores for training and testing dataset which is good as it therefore does not indicate any overfitting.\n",

    "Using a range of Machine Learning methods, we were able to take a dataset and predict whether an offer would be successful or not. This was used by spending a significant amount data cleansing & preprocessing. Some insight was given into the data however the bulk of the time was spent on creating and running machine learning models.\n",
    "It must be highlighted that the best model (RandomForest) took a significant amount of time to run. Even though it has given us the best results, I'm not certain that the percentage in accuracy increase is worth the time element. If we had a bigger dataset this could cause some serious efficiency issues. If I had more time, I would look at feature reduction on RandomForest to see how that would affect our results. Another approach to this dataset would be to create a recommendation engine as this could also give us some interesting insights into how Starbucks should send out offers."
